# Decide for me

## [Link to app](https://decide.jackzhang.me)

Let the computer decide a place for me because I hate making decisions :)

Built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Yelp Fusion API](https://fusion.yelp.com/).

### Usage

Search first with your preferred criteria, then click the dice to let the computer decide for you.

### Decision-making

The computer decides randomly based on the search results.
- Smart roll: the random choice is weighted based on the rating of the place, i.e. higher rating means higher chance of being chosen.
